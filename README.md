Detection and classification of cell nuclei in histologic imaging of the colon

The training and testing of the models has been performed with the CoNIC: Colon Nuclei Identification and Counting Challenge dataset, making the division between both sets according to the same challenge.

The aim of this work was to make a comparison of some of the main neural network models based on one of the largest cellular image datasets. For more information visit: https://conic-challenge.grand-challenge.org/Data/
